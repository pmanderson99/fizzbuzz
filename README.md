Fizz Buzz is a common developer interview question where
the challenge is to write a FizzBuzz.java program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100.
If the number is divisible by 3, the program has to print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
If it is divisible by 5, it has to print "Buzz". If both (multiples of 3 & 5) apply, it has to print "FizzBuzz".

Here's how I solved it:
-I started by building a FizzBuzz class with an empty main() method
-then wrote a for loop that starts at 1 and iterates to 100.
-and then inside the for loop I put a few if statements in
-the first if statement tests whether the current number is a multiple of 3 AND 5
-the next else if statement tests wheather the current number is a multiple of 3
-then the next else if tests wheather the current number is a multiple of 5
-else just print the number and stop at 100
